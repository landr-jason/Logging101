In such a situation, the information contained in the error should be sufficient for a developper to investigate (and hopefully fix) the issue, as well as isolate and re-process problematic entries. Some things to consider: entry identifier, what happened?, where in the code?, what action was taken? \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, particular consideration should be taken when the end-user is not a developper. Error messages should help them fix or report a problem. Cryptic references to source code are not useful in this context. Such details should be sent to a separate log, which can be cross-referenced with the user report to obtain a fuller picture during diagnosis.\n",

    "#### Formatters\n",
    "Logs are only as useful as the information they contain. As such, it is important to include some context around the log messages. This can be accomplished with log formatting. A full list of available attributes is available here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "For most use cases, including the log level, message (with variable data) and the date/time is good enough:\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if traceback information is important for a particular log message, `logging.exception` should be used because it appends this information automatically or call `logging.error` with \t`exc_info` set to true (`logging.error(e, exc_info=True)`). \n",

    "### Using a custom logger\n",
    "So far logging was being done through the default (also known as \"root\") logger. This is generally accepted to be an anti-pattern since it means all modules use the same logger, and becomes particularly problematic since `logging.basicConfig` cannot be changed once set. Imported modules would therefore be unable to modify the logger, and all logs would end up in the same outputs regardless of their origin."

Any properties set on a parent logger will be applied to the child modules unless overriden. As such, if the root logger has `level=logging.ERROR`, and your custom logger does not set a level. The child logger will inherit `level=logging.ERROR` from the root logger, rather than the usual default of WARNING.\n",

The \"bob.burger\" will be a child of the \"bob\" logger, and inherit it's properties. An exception being that if \"bob.burger\" is created before \"bob\", both will have \"root\" as their parent.\n"
